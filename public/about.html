<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name's Rich, and this is my web dev portfolio. I'm teaching myself how to code, and this will hopefully document my progress. I currently work in the audio visual world. I have a love for music, gaming, podcasts, tv, movies, books, and calisthenics. My goal in life right now is to change careers, and once I succeed I plan to spend more time playing music!
